# Project Name: RetailPulse

RetailPulse is an AI-powered retail intelligence platform designed to support small and medium businesses in making faster and more informed market decisions.

## Problem

Retail teams often rely on manual analysis to understand demand trends, pricing signals, and competitor movements.  
Data exists in many forms, but turning it into clear decisions is difficult and time-consuming. This leads to slow reactions to market changes and missed opportunities.

## Solution

RetailPulse brings key market insights into one place through an AI-driven dashboard.  
Instead of reading complex reports, users can quickly understand what is happening in the market and what actions they should consider.

The platform includes:

- Market intelligence analytics
- Demand trend visualization
- Pricing and risk indicators
- An AI Copilot that answers business questions in natural language

## Core Features

1. **Overview Dashboard**  
   Displays demand index, risk level, pricing strategy, and trend graphs to give users a quick snapshot of market conditions.

2. **Market Intelligence Module**  
   Provides sector demand comparison and market share visualization to help teams understand where opportunities exist.

3. **AI Copilot**  
   Allows users to ask questions like “Which sector is growing?” or “Should I adjust pricing?” and receive contextual insights.

4. **Data-Driven Design**  
   Focuses on clarity, usability, and simple decision signals rather than complex analytics.

## Technology Stack

- Frontend: Next.js (App Router), TailwindCSS, Recharts
- Backend: Next.js API routes for AI Copilot logic
- Deployment: Vercel
- AI Layer: LLM-based reasoning used to generate insights and recommendations

## Goal

The goal of RetailPulse is to make business intelligence accessible to smaller retail teams by combining visual analytics with AI-assisted explanations.

## Why AI is Needed

Market data can be complex and difficult to interpret quickly.  
RetailPulse uses AI to translate raw signals into understandable insights, allowing users to ask natural language questions and receive clear recommendations without needing deep analytical expertise.
