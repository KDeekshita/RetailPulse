# RetailPulse — AI Retail Intelligence Platform

RetailPulse is a lightweight AI-powered retail intelligence dashboard built to help small and medium businesses understand market demand, pricing signals, and risk trends in real time.

## 💡 What Problem Does It Solve?

Retail teams often struggle to make quick decisions because market data is scattered across tools.
Understanding demand shifts, competitor behaviour, or pricing strategy usually takes time and manual analysis.

RetailPulse simplifies this by turning market signals into clear, actionable insights.

## 🚀 Features

* **Overview Dashboard**
  Quick signals like Demand Index, Market Risk, Price Strategy, and weekly trend forecasts.

* **Market Intelligence**
  Sector demand comparison and market share visualizations to understand industry movement.

* **AI Copilot**
  Ask questions like:

  * “Which sector is strongest?”
  * “Should I increase price?”
  * “Market risk today?”

  The system generates contextual insights using an AI reasoning layer.

## 🤖 Why AI?

Retail decisions are rarely based on a single number.
RetailPulse uses AI to interpret multiple signals together and generate clear explanations, helping users make faster decisions without deep technical analysis.
